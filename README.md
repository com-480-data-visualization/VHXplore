## 📘 Project Overview

As computer science students, we interact with a wide range of programming languages in our daily work. While we often choose languages based on their features or performance, few of us pause to consider their origins—when they were created, who developed them, where they came from, how popular they are today, or even what their names mean.

In this project, we aim to present a comprehensive and interactive visualization of the most influential programming languages, starting from the 1950s. Our goal is to make this information engaging and accessible, combining historical and technical insights with visual storytelling.

## 🎯 What Our Visualizations Highlight

- **Temporal trends**  
  When each language was developed and how they evolved over time.

- **Popularity metrics**  
  Including the number of books published, academic papers produced, and estimated user base.

- **Geographic origins**  
  Showing the top 7 languages from each country on a world map, offering a global perspective on programming language development.

- **Technical relationships**  
  Exploring performance characteristics and how languages are interconnected.

- **Naming origins**  
  Revealing the often surprising or humorous stories behind language names.

By blending data with design, we hope this project provides both educational value and exploratory enjoyment for anyone interested in the evolution of programming languages.

## 🧪 How to Run This Project

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with D3.js) and runs entirely in the browser. No backend or build tools are required.

### 🚀 Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Open the HTML file in your browser**

    Simply double-click the main HTML file (e.g., index.html) or right-click and choose "Open with" → your browser of choice.
    
    💡 If you see issues loading data (like from .csv or .json files), it might be due to browser security policies.
    
3. **(Optional) Run with a local server**
    
    To avoid any browser restrictions when loading local files, run a lightweight local server:

    - Using Python 3:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

    - Using VSCode Live Server:

    Install the Live Server extension, right-click the HTML file, and select "Open with Live Server".
